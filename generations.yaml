    description: "The first generation Kia Seltos debuted as a compact crossover SUV positioned between the Soul and Sportage in Kia's lineup. It featured distinctive styling with a tiger-nose grille, LED lighting, and a two-tone roof option. Power came from either a 2.0L naturally aspirated engine with 146 HP or a 1.6L turbocharged option producing 175 HP, paired with CVT or 7-speed dual-clutch transmissions. The Seltos offered a relatively spacious interior for its segment, with a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, available premium Bose audio, and Kia's comprehensive suite of driver assistance features. With its competitive pricing, attractive styling, and tech-forward approach, the first-generation Seltos quickly established itself in the crowded subcompact SUV market."

    description: "The second generation Kia Seltos received a significant refresh with bolder exterior styling, including a revised front fascia with a wider grille and updated LED lighting with a distinctive light bar. The interior was upgraded with a dual 10.25-inch panoramic display combining the digital instrument cluster and infotainment touchscreen. New tech features included available power liftgate, ventilated front seats, and expanded driver assistance systems. The powertrain options carried over from the previous generation but with refinements to improve efficiency and drivability. All-wheel drive remained optional across most trims. The redesigned Seltos maintained its positioning as a tech-forward compact crossover with distinctive styling and practical interior space, building on the success of the first generation while offering modern enhancements to compete with rivals in the increasingly competitive segment."
